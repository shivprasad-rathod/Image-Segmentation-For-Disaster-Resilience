# Image-Segmentation-For-Disaster-Resilience
The Image Segmentation for Disaster Resilience system utilizes Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) to analyze satellite and drone imagery for detecting and assessing damage caused by natural disasters. This system aids in disaster response, resource allocation, and recovery planning by segmenting affected regions in real-time.
